                <p>One way to generate high quality printed business output is to use preprinted forms. Along with this comes the many forms to design, boxes of each to buy, no easy way to change them, and the associated expense. Plus, you had to buy the impact line printers, the inconvenience of storing and changing all those forms, and the loss of the space these things needed.</p>
                <p>The latest generation of laser printers are small, inexpensive to buy and operate, and offer the convenience of printing on plain white paper. No forms to buy or paper to change. Networked laser printers can be installed almost anywhere, and are typically faster than all but the most expensive line printers.</p>
                <p>How do you take advantage of laser printing? You might have a legacy system with fixed output, and no access or desire to modify source code. Even if you could, do you understand the technology to create and use laser printed forms and logos. If you do, do you have the time to spend doing this? We have a product that will take the same output now generated and do the work for you. No changes to your programs!</p>
                <p>Our customers use <strong>LFPS</strong> to print W2 forms, payroll statements, purchase orders, invoices, checks and more.</p>
                <p>It does not matter what language your system is written in, or what database it uses. If you are using an AIX based IBM p series (formerly RS6000) system, and have a PostScript printer, you can take advantage of this simple and inexpensive product. The form is created in PostScript, logos are created as stroked EPS files, using any product you wish. You can create these or Pulsar Systems can do it for you. The output data file is "fit" to your laser form one time. Define an AIX spool queue, or if you are a Universe user add a simple print driver, and you are ready to go. No more preprinted forms to buy or paper to change! Modify the form, company information, logos or anything else right up to the minute you print. You can also send reports or other output that would normally be printed on computer paper to a laser printer. New forms, logos, or printers can easily be added at any time.</p>
                <p>Our technology is simple. Your current system spools output to a print queue. <strong>LFPS</strong> takes that output, processes it, and then sends it to the laser printer of choice. If your business has multiple companies, logos, addresses, etc. this is the perfect solution. You design the form once, and then use it with any logo and address. The three are combined with your data at the time of output and assembled into a single page. Since the output is totally transparent to your current programs, you need to identify the form, logo, and printer you want to use for each file spooled, and <strong>LFPS</strong> does the rest.</p>
                <p>Depending upon how you choose to create your forms and logos, you could have your first laser printed form output in a few hours. Many PC based products are available to simplify this part of the job. If you don't want to do it yourself, Pulsar Systems can create the logo(s) and form(s) for you. There is a small one-time fee for each logo or form. You receive the source for each, and can modify it yourself thereafter. Finally, a sample of your printed output is "fit" to the form using the features of <strong>LFPS</strong>. With a little practice you can usually fit the data to the form in less than an hour. Pulsar Systems can also perform this step for you. After that, you define a few configuration files and are ready to go.</p>
